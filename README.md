## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite

Initial configuration:
- npm create vite@latest
- select react + javascript
- npm install
- git init
- *follow instructions on github repository for the rest*

Building the site: 
- followed Airbnb styling guidelines
- inspired from figma design

Deploying the site:
- import github repo to netlify
- change site name

DONE! :)

## Optimizations

I plan to make this a fullstack app with login feature, user can add, update and delete their experiences and possibly share with others. 

## Lessons Learned:

This site taught me about props! What a wonderful way to write composable code and reusable compenents with different data. Still get blown away learning all these exciting things in React!  

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
